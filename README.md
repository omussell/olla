A HTML/CSS theme suitable for simple websites or documentation

## What?

A minimal HTML/CSS website theme

## Why?

I like using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for documentation. Especially on Python projects combined with [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings) for API docs and [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for a good looking theme.

However, it requires a lot of CSS and Javascript in order to function properly. As with all Python projects, you need a Python interpreter, virtualenv, pip, pip dependencies etc.... just to build the site.

Another alternative for documentation sites is [Doctave](https://www.doctave.com/).

Hugo and Zola can be used to generate static sites, but creating new themes can be quite difficult. The documentation themes are also quite complicated. 

So the purpose of this theme is to be minimal and functional for normal sites or blogs and also for documentation.
